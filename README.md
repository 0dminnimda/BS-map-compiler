# BS map compiler

Use this simple program for more convenient work with commas with separators.

Put the unallocated text document in the “input” folder, then run decompile.py. Upon completion, the CSV file, which is more convenient for editing than text, will be located in the “middle of the process” folder.

To turn CSV, which is “in the middle of the process”, into text, you need to run compile.py, as a result, you will get a text file that you changed.
