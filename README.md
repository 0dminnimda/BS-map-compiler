# BS map compiler

Use this simple program for more convenient work with comma-separated tables.

1. Put the unseparated text document in the "input" folder, then run decompile.py. After compilation, the CSV file, which is more convenient for editing than text, will be located in the "middle of the process" folder.

2. Edit the CSV file as you need.

3. To turn the CSV file, located in the "middle of the process" folder, into text, you need to run compile.py, as a result you will get a text file that you changed.
